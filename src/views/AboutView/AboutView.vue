    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi there! My name is <span class="highlight">Salim Thaifa</span> and I'm the developer behind
      this app.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took immense pleasure in crafting and developing this application. It has been a labor of
      love, and I'm thrilled to share it with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the development process, I made a conscious effort to keep the app as structured as
      possible. I believe that a well-organized codebase leads to better functionality and
      maintainability.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm aware that there is always room for improvement, and I'm committed to continuously
      enhancing this app. I have many exciting ideas and features in mind to make it even better.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the core features of this app is the ability to filter meals and display them
      correctly. It showcases the power of efficient data manipulation and presentation. I've put a
      lot of effort into ensuring that the filtering mechanism is intuitive and user-friendly.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thank you for using this app and being a part of this journey. Your feedback and support are
      invaluable to me.
